# TCP Server

A lightweight, concurrent **TCP Server** implementation in Go. This project demonstrates idiomatic Go patterns, including the use of channels for state management, goroutines for connection handling, and the `slog` package for structured logging.

##  Features

* **Concurrent Connection Handling:** Uses goroutines to manage multiple peer connections simultaneously without blocking.
* **Channel-Based Communication:** Safely handles peer registration and message processing using Go channels.
* **Structured Logging:** Implements `slog` for modern, structured log output.
* **Robust Peer Management:** Decoupled `Peer` logic for reading raw TCP streams into a centralized message buffer.

##  Architecture

The server is built on three main components:

1. **Server:** Manages the listener socket, peer registry, and the main event loop.
2. **Peer:** Represents a connected client. Each peer runs its own `readLoop` to stream data back to the server.
3. **Message Loop:** A central `select` block that processes incoming raw messages and peer additions sequentially to avoid race conditions.

### Testing the Connection

You can test the server using `netcat` or `telnet`:

```bash
# Connect to the server
nc/telnet localhost 5001

# Type a message and hit Enter
Yo baby!

```
```
